To see this Cover-Letter, download the files on the repo then simply open the "Index.html" file in your browser. 

NOTES:
In this file you will see that I've created a pretty decent Cover-Letter that highlights my ability to understand basic HTML Architecture, CSS and the Box Model, and ES5 JavaScript Convention and Workflow. As well as clear understanding of Seperation of Concerns. I also, by the way, do use bootstrp in my code :)
